This is the Application that uses API for displaying Movies or TV Shows related to user's needs. You need to click on Details of each Movie/TV Show or even to search for this content In search bar. For this app I used core principles of object-oriented programming. I have used JavaScript and React concepts with CSS and HTML. For better functioning I used multiple React Hooks,useContext, classes, encapsulation and polymorphism. You can find this application deployed on Netlify: "https://movies23.netlify.app/" It's working for both mobile and web.
